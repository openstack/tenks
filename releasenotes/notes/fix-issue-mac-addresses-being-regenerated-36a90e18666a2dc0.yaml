    Fixes an issue where tenks was regenerating the MAC addresses for the
    network interfaces used by the backing virtual machines on each run. This
    would lead to a mismatch between the MAC address set on the baremetal port
    in Ironic and the MAC address of the virtual machine's network interface.
